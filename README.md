# Proiect-Baza-de-Date
Interfata grafica a unei baze de date pentru o firma de curierat . 
This is the graphic interface of a database used for a delivery company . 
Here we have 5 tables : Angajati(employees) , Zona(the area in which they work) , Client(customers) , Colet(packages that will be delivered) 
and Masina(the cars used for deliveries) 
The graphic interface begins with the LoginPage in which the employees will log in with their name and their CNP(social security number) . 
After the log in was successful the HomePage opens which leads us to the page "Inregistrari" 
in which we have options to see all the recordings for all the tables mentioned above . Also from "Inregistrari" 
we can go to the page "Statistici" in which we have 4 different tables containing the results of 4 different complex queries .
In addition , in the tables Client and Colet we can do the following actions : Insert , Update , Delete or Reset (reset the table with recordings) .
